# RFM-Analysis

The RFM analysis serves as a solid statistical support for customer segmentation in sales and marketing. 

1.	Data wrangling
2.	RFM score calculations : there are 2 ways to calculate RFM (recency : when is the last time the customer makes the purchase. Frequency : how often does the customer shop at our store / platform. Monetary value : customer lifelong value) scores for each customer, fixed value or dynamic value. Fixed value can be decided by historical data and experience of senior management, for example, if a customerâ€™s last visit is within 7 days, he / she get 4 points on recency, someone who visit one year ago gets 1 point. The dynamic values is calculated through percentage, for example, a  company wants to divide customer base into 4 tiers, then we set customers who have 25% lifelong value as 4 points, and the bottom 25% as 1 point. After adding scores from recency, frequency and monetary value, customers are then categorized into tiers or groups based on the total RFM score.
3.	Visualization : visualize the distribution of each customer group to generate more insights and implement strategies accordingly.
